## Contributing

We use GitHub Flow for our development process. Follow these steps to commit your changes:

### 1. Fork the Repository

First, fork the repository to your own GitHub account:

1. Navigate to the [main repository](https://github.com/luftdaten-at/datahub.git).
2. Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the repository page.
3. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

### 2. Clone the Forked Repository

Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/datahub.git
cd datahub
```

### 3. Create a Branch

Create a new branch to work on your changes. Use the following naming convention: `feature/{issue-number}-{issue-name}`. 

For example, if you are working on issue #123 to add user authentication, you would name your branch:

```sh
git checkout -b feature/123-add-user-authentication
```

### 4. Make Your Changes

Make your changes to the codebase. Ensure you:

- Write clear and concise commit messages.
- Test your changes thoroughly.
- Follow the coding standards and guidelines of the project.

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Commit your changes to the branch:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
```

### 6. Push to Your Fork

Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub:

```sh
git push origin feature/123-add-user-authentication
```

### 7. Open a Pull Request

Navigate to the main repository on GitHub, and you should see a prompt to open a pull request for your branch. Click "Compare & pull request":

1. Provide a clear and concise title for the pull request.
2. Include a detailed description of your changes and any relevant information.
3. Reference the issue number in the description using keywords like `fixes`, `closes`, or `resolves` followed by the issue number (e.g., `fixes #123`).
4. Request a review from the repository maintainers.

### 8. Review Process

Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers. Be prepared to make additional changes based on their feedback. Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main branch.

### 9. Keep Your Fork Up-to-Date

To keep your fork updated with the latest changes from the main repository, add the original repository as a remote and pull the latest changes:

```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/luftdaten-at/datahub.git
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

### 10. Delete Your Branch

After your pull request has been merged, you can safely delete your branch:

```sh
git branch -d feature/123-add-user-authentication
git push origin --delete feature/123-add-user-authentication
```

By following these steps, you can contribute effectively using GitHub Flow. Thank you for your contributions!
